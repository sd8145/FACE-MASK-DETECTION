Recursion is a way of solving a problem where the solution to the problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

This code is an example of how to use a library called OpenCV to detect if people are wearing masks or not in a video feed coming from a camera. It uses two detection methods called Haar cascades, one to detect faces, and another one to detect eyes. It is assuming that if eyes are detected within a face, the person is wearing a mask. The code captures video frames from the camera and checks for faces in each frame, then checks for eyes within the region of the detected faces. If eyes are detected it displays "Mask" and if eyes are not detected it displays "No Mask" on the video frame.

It is important to note that this is a simple example and the real-world performance will not be accurate, more advanced models and image pre-processing can be used for more accurate results.
